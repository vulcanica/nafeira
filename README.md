# Vercel Shop

A Next.js storefront template and reference architecture for Shopify, built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and the Shopify Storefront API.

See [vercel.shop](https://vercel.shop) for full documentation.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fshop&project-name=shop&repository-name=shop&root-directory=apps%2Ftemplate&demo-title=Vercel+Shop&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-template.vercel.app&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN%2CNEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN&envDescription=Required%20Shopify%20Storefront%20API%20credentials&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fvercel.shop%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fenv-vars)

Vercel prompts for the two required Shopify credentials before the first deployment.

## Getting Started

1. Scaffold a new project using the CLI:

```sh
npx create-vercel-shop@latest my-store
```

The scaffold also installs these project-scoped agent plugins:

- `vercel-shop`
- `vercel-plugin`
- `shopify-ai-toolkit`

To install only the agent plugins into an existing project, run this from that project's root:

```sh
npx create-vercel-shop@latest --no-template
```

2. In Shopify admin, create a storefront token in **Settings → Apps and sales channels → Headless**, enable the required Storefront API permissions, then add your Shopify credentials:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token
```

3. Start the development server with the same package manager you used to scaffold the project:

```sh
pnpm dev
npm run dev
yarn dev
bun dev
```

See [vercel.shop/docs/getting-started](https://vercel.shop/docs/getting-started) for the full setup guide and [Storefront API Permissions](https://vercel.shop/docs/reference/storefront-api-permissions) for the complete scope reference.
